I must confess that over the past few years I have been gravely disappointed with the white moderate. I have almost reached the 
regrettable conclusion that the Negro’s great stumbling block in his stride toward freedom is not the White Citizen’s Counciler 
or the Ku Klux Klanner, but the white moderate, who is more devoted to “order” than to justice; who prefers a negative peace 
which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice; who constantly says: “I agree with you in 
the goal you seek, but I cannot agree with your methods of direct action”; who paternalistically believes he can set the 
timetable for another man’s freedom; who lives by a mythical concept of time and who constantly advises the Negro to wait for a 
“more convenient season.”
